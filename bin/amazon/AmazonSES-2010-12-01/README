This is a code sample showing how to use the Amazon E-Mail Service from the 
command line.  To learn more about this code sample, see the AWS E-Mail 
Service Developer Guide. 

Before running this code sample, you must fulfill the following prerequisites:

* You must have an Amazon Web Services account, and must also sign up for the
  Amazon E-Mail Service.  See the AWS E-Mail Service Getting Started Guide 
  for more information.

* You must install Perl version 5.6.0 or later.  If you already have Perl 
  installed, you can determine your version number by typing

      perl -v

  at the command prompt.  If you do not have Perl installed, go to 
  http://www.perl.org for more information.

* Depending on the version of Perl that you are using, you may need to install
  some additional Perl modules.  To install these modules, run the following
  commands:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Digest::SHA'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install URI::Escape'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::LWP'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install MIME::Base64'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::SSLeay'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install XML::LibXML'
